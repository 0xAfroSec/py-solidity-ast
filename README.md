- [x] Generate code snippets from nodes

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

You can install the latest release via `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install py-solidity-ast
```

## Usage üíª

First, use [py-solc-x](https://github.com/iamdefinitelyahuman/py-solc-x) to compile your contracts to the [standard JSON output format](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html#output-description).

```python
import json
import solcx
input_json = json.load(open('input.json'))
output_json = solcx.compile_standard(input_json)
```

Next, import `py-solidity-ast` and initialize using `from_standard_output_json` or `from_standard_output`. This returns a list of `SourceUnit` objects, which each represent the base AST node in a Solidity source file.

```python
import py-solidity-ast

nodes = py-solidity-ast.from_standard_output(output_json)

nodes
#output: [<SourceUnit iterable 'contracts/Token.sol'>, <SourceUnit iterable 'contracts/SafeMath.sol'>]
```

You can also generate a single `SourceUnit` directly from that source's AST:

```python
import py-solidity-ast

node = py-solidity-ast.from_ast(output_json["sources"]["contracts/Token.sol"]["ast"])

node
# output: <SourceUnit iterable 'contracts/Token.sol'>
```

### Interacting with Nodes üåê

Each node has the following attributes:

```python
node
# the current node is a FunctinoDefinition node with the name 'mul'
# output: <FunctionDefinition iterable 'mul'>

node.name
# output: "mul"

node.depth  # Number of nodes between this node and the SourceUnit
# output: 2

node.src  # The 'src' information of the node "start:length:1"
# output: "4948:1477:1"

node.contract_id  # Contract ID as given by the standard compiler JSON
# output: 2

node.fields  # List of fields for this node
['baseNodeType', 'documentation', 'id', 'implemented', 'kind', 'modifiers', 'name', 'nodeType', 'nodes', 'parameters', 'returnParameters', 'scope', 'src', 'stateMutability', 'superFunction', 'visibility']

```

Fields mostly follow the expected [AST grammar](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/grammar.html). One notable difference: `Block` nodes are omitted and the body of each `Block` is available within it's parent as the attribute `nodes`. Nodes containing a body are iterable and can be accessed with list-like syntax. Additionally, any child node with a `name` field is accessible using dict-like syntax.

The following additional fields are also available:

- Most nodes have a `baseNodeType` field as defined in [grammar.py](py-solidity-ast/grammar.py)
- `ContractDefinition` nodes have `dependencies` and `libraries` fields that point to related `ContractDefinition` nodes

Some Examples:

#### Code Selection Documentation

The code selection below demonstrates the use of the `py-solidity-ast` tool to extract information from a Solidity source code file.

The `source_node` variable represents the root node of the Solidity AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) for the source code file.

The `nodes` attribute of the `source_node` variable contains a list of all the nodes in the AST. In this case, it contains a `PragmaDirective` node and a `ContractDefinition` node.

The `source_node[1]` and `source_node['SafeMath']` expressions both retrieve the `ContractDefinition` node for the `SafeMath` contract.

The `nodes` attribute of the `source_node['SafeMath']` variable contains a list of all the nodes in the `SafeMath` contract. In this case, it contains five `FunctionDefinition` nodes.

The `source_node['SafeMath']['mul']` expression retrieves the `FunctionDefinition` node for the `mul` function in the `SafeMath` contract.

The `nodes` attribute of the `source_node['SafeMath']['mul']` variable contains a list of all the nodes in the `mul` function. In this case, it contains an `IfStatement` node, a `VariableDeclarationStatement` node, a `FunctionCall` node, and a `Return` node.

```python

source_node
# output: <SourceUnit iterable 'contracts/math/SafeMath.sol'>

source_node.nodes
# output: [<PragmaDirective object>, <ContractDefinition iterable 'SafeMath'>]

source_node[1]
# output: <ContractDefinition iterable 'SafeMath'>

source_node['SafeMath']
# output: <ContractDefinition iterable 'SafeMath'>

source_node['SafeMath'].fields
['baseContracts', 'children', 'contractDependencies', 'contractKind', 'contract_id', 'dependencies', 'depth', 'documentation', 'fullyImplemented', 'id', 'is_child_of', 'is_parent_of', 'keys', 'libraries', 'linearizedBaseContracts', 'name', 'nodeType', 'nodes', 'offset', 'parent', 'parents', 'scope', 'src']

source_node['SafeMath'].nodes
[<FunctionDefinition iterable 'add'>, <FunctionDefinition iterable 'sub'>, <FunctionDefinition iterable 'mul'>, # output: <FunctionDefinition iterable 'div'>, <FunctionDefinition iterable 'mod'>]

source_node['SafeMath']['mul']
# output: # output: <FunctionDefinition iterable 'mul'>

source_node['SafeMath']['mul']
# output: [<IfStatement object>, <VariableDeclarationStatement object>, <FunctionCall object>, <Return object>]
```

### Exploring the Tree üìä

The `Node.children()` method is used to search and filter through child nodes of a given node. It takes any of the following keyword arguments:

- `depth`: Number of levels of children to traverse. `0` returns only this node.
- `include_self`: Includes this node in the results.
- `include_parents`: Includes nodes that match in the results, when they also have child nodes that match.
- `include_children`: If True, as soon as a match is found it's children will not be included in the search.
- `required_offset`: Only match nodes with a source offset that contains this offset.
- `offset_limits`: Only match nodes when their source offset is contained inside this source offset.
- `filters`: Dictionary of `{'attribute': "value"}` that children must match. Can also be given as a list of dicts, children that match any of the dicts will be returned.
- `exclude_filter`: Dictionary of `{'attribute': "value"}` that children cannot match.

```python
node = s['Token']['transfer']
node.children(
    include_children=False,
    filters={'nodeType': "FunctionCall", "expression.name": "require"}
)
# output: [<FunctionCall>]
```

`Node.parent()` and `Node.parents()` are used to travel back up the tree. They take the following arguments:

- `depth`: Depth limit. If given as a negative value, it will be subtracted from this object's depth.
- `filters`: Dictionary of `{'attribute': "value"}` that parents must match.

`Node.parent()` returns one result, `Node.parents()` returns a list of matches.

```python
node.parents()
# output: [<ContractDefinition iterable 'Token'>, <SourceUnit iterable object 'contracts/Token.sol'>]
```

The `Node.find_node()` and `Node.find_nodes()` methods are used to search the tree for a node with desired attributes that has parent and children nodes that match the given filters. They take the following arguments:

- `node_filters`: Dictionary of `{'attribute': "value"}` that the node must match. Can also be a list of dicts, the node must match any of the dicts.
- `parent_filters`: Dictionary of `{'attribute': "value"}` that the node's parents must match. Can also be a list of dicts, the node's parents must match any of the dicts.
- `child_filters`: Dictionary of `{'attribute': "value"}` that the node's children must match. Can also be a list of dicts, the node's children must match any of the dicts.
- `node_depth`: Depth limit for the node. If given as a negative value, it will be subtracted from this object's depth.
- `parent_depth`: Depth limit for the node's parents. If given as a negative value, it will be subtracted from this object's depth.
- `child_depth`: Depth limit for the node's children. If given as a negative value, it will be subtracted from this object's depth.

`find_node()` returns a `True` and a tuple of the node, its parent and its child; returns `False` and None if no match. `find_nodes()` returns the same as `find_node()`, but returns a list of all matches.

```python
node.find_node(
    node_filters={'nodeType': "Identifier","name": "require"},
    parent_filters={'kind': "FunctionCall"},
    child_filters={'typeString': "BinaryOperation", "operator": "!="},
    node_depth=1,
    parent_depth=-1,
    child_depth=1
)
# output: False, (None, None, None)
```

The `child_has_attributes()` and `children_have_attributes` methods are used to check if a node has a child or children with the given attributes.

```python
node.child_has_attributes({'nodeType': "Identifier", "expression.name": "require"})

# output: True, <Identifier object 'require'>
```

`parent_has_attributes()` and `parents_have_attributes()` function the same way as `child_has_attributes()`and`children_have_attributes()`, but search up the tree instead of down.

### Interacting with Nodes and Source Code üìù

The AST parser can also generate code snippets from the AST using the source code of the contract.
`Node.extract_code()` returns a string of the code at the node's src location. It takes the following arguments:

- `source_code`: The source code of the contract
- `loc`: If True, the code will be returned with line numbers. If False, the code will be returned without line numbers. Defaults to True.
- `tags`: If True, the code will be returned with tags like '//@audit' and '//@info' that can be used to annotate the code. If False, the code will be returned without tags. Defaults to True.

```python
contract_node = from_ast(file['ast'])

contract_node
# output: <SourceUnit iterable 'contracts/Token.sol'>

success, child = contract_node.child_has_attributes({'nodeType': "Identifier", "expression.name": "require"})
# output: success = True, child = <Identifier object 'require'>

child.extract_code(source_code, loc=True)
# output: 99: require(success, "RdpxReserve: transfer failed");
```

Lastly, you can fetch the line numbers of a node using the `Node.get_line_numbers()` . It returns the start and end lines of the node as a tuple.
